| **Advanced** | What is the difference between `parallelStream` and `stream`?            | `parallelStream` executes operations in multiple threads, whereas `stream` uses a single thread.                                                                   |
| **Advanced** | Explain the Observer design pattern in Java.                              | Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.                                                           |
| **Advanced** | What is the Decorator Pattern?                                             | A structural design pattern used to dynamically add behavior to an object.                                                                                         |
